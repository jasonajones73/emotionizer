# The Emotionizer

## Purpose
This is a Shiny application built to help anyone that needs to quickly process text data from PDF documents. The original purpose of this application was to support text processing for large local government budget documents. Students at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) used this application in one of their Data Science courses in partnership with Guilford County Government.

The application is very simple. You upload a PDF document and then promptly see some quick information about the text in the document. You then have the option to download two different version of the text data from the PDF. One option is just a .csv file which includes all of the text indexed by page and the other option is a .csv file which includes the text joined with the NRC lexicon with associated counts.
